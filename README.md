# Build My Own Search Engine using searXNG, Docker, Linode

This project aims to build a custom search engine using searXNG, Docker, and Linode. By leveraging these technologies, you can create your own private search engine with enhanced privacy and control.

## Setup Guide

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your local machine.
2. Clone the searXNG repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd searxng
   ```

4. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t searxng .
   ```

5. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8888:8888 searxng
   ```

6. Access the search engine by opening your browser and visiting `http://localhost:8888`.

## Deployment on Linode

To deploy your search engine on Linode, follow these steps:

1. Create a Linode account and set up a new Linode instance.
2. SSH into your Linode instance.
3. Install Docker on your Linode instance.
4. Clone the searXNG repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng.git
   ```

5. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd searxng
   ```

6. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t searxng .
   ```

7. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8888:8888 searxng
   ```

8. Access your search engine by opening your browser and visiting `http://<your-linode-ip>:8888`.

Feel free to customize and enhance your search engine according to your requirements.
